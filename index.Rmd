#### **SUGESTED VENUE FOR THE ACTIVITY: MASIA ALDAMAR**

* **Location** 25 minutes drive from Valencia city centre
* **Facilities** Gardens and Pool 

**Masía Aldamar** is a spectacular country estate, dedicated to orange growing, just 15km from the centre of Valencia and a mere 5 minutes from the airport. The estate dates from the(**15th century** and still maintains its original patios, wineries, oil press and chapel. The unique spaces offer the chance to hold one-of-a-kind events: the chapel for civil ceremonies, an ancient cobbled patio, a large capacity main hall and a hundred-year-old garden with the traditional pool that is a feature of Valencia ́s orange growing activity. There is also a second winery where the estate’s original wine-making activity has been revived.

### **COOKING CHALLENGE**

* **Location** CITY CENTRE
* **Facilities** Food and fun space 
* **Duration** 18h to 22h

_What can be more rewarding and exciting than knowing that you can prepare something delicious? What's more pleasant than seeing you in that wonderful place where the difference between work and fun disappears in a cloud of flour, in the aromatic steam that comes out of a pot or between glasses of a good red wine?_

A different and exciting gastronomic experience in the **"Master Chef"** style in which the participants will elaborate **different tapas recipes** and compete for the best results following the chef's guidelines. At least **one of the recipes will be creative**, based on a main ingredient determined by the chef, with the rest of the ingredients being freely chosen.

Attendees, organized into **work teams**, will **cook the dishes with local products** in a time limit. On the other hand, the teams will be free to give free rein to their imagination and intuition when it comes to developing the creative tapa. A **market zone** will be offered in which all the ingredients necessary to make the tapas will be found.

The objective will be to discover talents and promote the cohesion of the group from a cook born of emotions, governed by intuition and spontaneity, where you put the limits. Cuisine made from the heart so that each dish is an experience.

At the end **the group will taste** and share everything prepared in a unique and unforgettable dinner, because a good bite remains in the memory forever. The dishes, as well as the work of each team, will be valued and scored by the chef, who will **reward the winners*.**

### **ALBUFERA NATIONAL PARK**

* **Location** 12km from Valencia, inside the Natural Park 

* **Duration of the activity** 2 hours Paella cooking activity plus dinner

* **Teams**: 8/9 people 

La Albufera is a freshwater lagoon and estuary on the Gulf of Valencia coast of the Valencian Community. It is the main portion of the Parc Natural de l'Albufera de València ("Valencian Albufera Natural Park"), with a surface area of 21,120 hectares (52,200 acres). The natural biodiversity of the nature reserve allows a great variety of flora and fauna to thrive and be observed year-round. Though once a saltwater lagoon, dilution due to irrigation and canals draining into the estuary and the sand bars increasing in size had converted it to freshwater by the seventeenth century.

The activity we suggest is a cooking activity in La Barraca del Palmar.
**¿What is Barraca?** Formerly, it was the typical dwelling in Valencia. It was used both for housing and for storage as well as for the fishermen. At present some are still preserved. You can find the ”modern" (built with materials other than traditional) and old ones. Many of the latter are in poor condition, due in some cases to the carelessness of the owners and the lack of interest for their conservation by official bodies. 
However “La Barraca del Palmar” of Albufera is restored to accommodate huge groups such as yours. Also, is pretty well located due to provides views to the lake.

<img src = "https://cdn1.guias-viajar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fotos-valencia-barraca-albufera-014.jpg">

**The activity** The activity will consist in a Paella  cooking. Paella is the most traditional dish in Valencia, and it has all kind of variations such as Vegetables paella, shellfish paella, etc.
The group will be split in different groups and each one will make their own paella. 
A set of instructors will be giving advise to the participants during the workshop.

**The dinner** Once they had finished with the workshop, they will have the pleasure to taste their own creations. But it won’t be a traditional dinner in a simple place… The dinner will take place in a at the barraca Gardens overlooking the lake
