## **SUGESTED VENUE FOR THE ACTIVITY: MASIA ALDAMAR**

* **Location** 25 minutes drive from Valencia city centre
* **Facilities** Gardens and Pool 

**Masía Aldamar** is a spectacular country estate, dedicated to orange growing, just 15km from the centre of Valencia and a mere 5 minutes from the airport. The estate dates from the(**15th century** and still maintains its original patios, wineries, oil press and chapel. The unique spaces offer the chance to hold one-of-a-kind events: the chapel for civil ceremonies, an ancient cobbled patio, a large capacity main hall and a hundred-year-old garden with the traditional pool that is a feature of Valencia ́s orange growing activity. There is also a second winery where the estate’s original wine-making activity has been revived.
