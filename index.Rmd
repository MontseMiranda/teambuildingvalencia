#### **SUGESTED VENUE FOR THE ACTIVITY: MASIA ALDAMAR**

* **Location** 25 minutes drive from Valencia city centre
* **Facilities** Gardens and Pool 

**Masía Aldamar** is a spectacular country estate, dedicated to orange growing, just 15km from the centre of Valencia and a mere 5 minutes from the airport. The estate dates from the(**15th century** and still maintains its original patios, wineries, oil press and chapel. The unique spaces offer the chance to hold one-of-a-kind events: the chapel for civil ceremonies, an ancient cobbled patio, a large capacity main hall and a hundred-year-old garden with the traditional pool that is a feature of Valencia ́s orange growing activity. There is also a second winery where the estate’s original wine-making activity has been revived.

### **COOKING CHALLENGE**

* **Location** CITY CENTRE
* **Facilities** Food and fun space 
* **Duration** 18h to 22h

_What can be more rewarding and exciting than knowing that you can prepare something delicious? What's more pleasant than seeing you in that wonderful place where the difference between work and fun disappears in a cloud of flour, in the aromatic steam that comes out of a pot or between glasses of a good red wine?_

A different and exciting gastronomic experience in the **"Master Chef"** style in which the participants will elaborate **different tapas recipes** and compete for the best results following the chef's guidelines. At least **one of the recipes will be creative**, based on a main ingredient determined by the chef, with the rest of the ingredients being freely chosen.

Attendees, organized into **work teams**, will **cook the dishes with local products** in a time limit. On the other hand, the teams will be free to give free rein to their imagination and intuition when it comes to developing the creative tapa. A **market zone** will be offered in which all the ingredients necessary to make the tapas will be found.

The objective will be to discover talents and promote the cohesion of the group from a cook born of emotions, governed by intuition and spontaneity, where you put the limits. Cuisine made from the heart so that each dish is an experience.

At the end **the group will taste** and share everything prepared in a unique and unforgettable dinner, because a good bite remains in the memory forever. The dishes, as well as the work of each team, will be valued and scored by the chef, who will **reward the winners*.**
